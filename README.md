# About Me
## My Hobbies  
## In my spare time I love to go out in the sun. I feel as if gain powers like superman. The sun gives me energy. I do nails on the side at a local salon. Doing nails keeps me calm, and trains my patient. I also have five cats and spend alot of my time taking care of my fur babies.
## My Favoirte Websites 
## * [TikTok] (www.tiktok.com)  I love tiktok because of how the algorithim is so good. It is one of the only social apps that shows me content that I actually like.  * [CoolMathGames] (www.coolmathgames.com)  Coolmathgames has always had the most diverse set of free games since I was in middle school. Even though there were hundreds of games the website always loaded fast and worked smoothly, even on school wifi.
